Hello! I am Dion Mann, a third year graduate student in the mathematics department at UConn. I have been working on my Ph.D. under [Dr. Ambar Sengupta](https://math.uconn.edu/person/ambar-sengupta/), focusing in differential topology and mathematical physics. In 2023, I received my B.A. in mathematics and physics at the University of Colorado, Boulder with honors under the advising of [Dr. Markus Pflaum](https://www.colorado.edu/math/markus-pflaum).

I have a lot of interests to enjoy during my free time, although this "free time" comes and goes pretty quickly now-a-days. One of my comforts is in food; I enjoy trying new food at different places and cooking in general. I mostly cook Vietnamese food, which is what I grew up with. Things are most exciting when I make something up, since it is either atrocious or actually pretty delicious; it's fun to see what ingredients go well together (or don't). I also enjoy walking, learning languages, and video games. My current phase is a game called [Planet Crafter](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1284190/The_Planet_Crafter/). Previously, I was addicted to [Noita](https://store.steampowered.com/app/881100/Noita/). My [wife](https://math.uconn.edu/person/heidi-benham/) enjoys point-and-click adventure puzzle games, which I look forward to playing together with her as much as possible.

Research Interests
======
Broadly speaking, my interests are dominantly differential topology and mathematical physics. At the University of Colorado, Boulder, I submitted my [senior thesis](https://dionmann.github.io/seniorThesis) in deformation quantization to obtain honors. Deformation quantization is a quantization program introduced by F. Bayen, M. Flato, C. Fronsdal, A. Lichnerowicz, D. Sternheimer and involves an algebraic deformation (according to M. Gerstenhaber in [this paper](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1970484?seq=1)) of \\(C^\infty(M)\\), the algebra of smooth functions on a Poisson manifold \\(M\\). I remain interested in questions about mathematical quantization, although my interests have evolved into other areas.

Currently, I am studying gauge theory and diffeological spaces. Gauge theory is the study of connections on principal fiber bundles, which have high importance in physics (especially quantum field theory). On the other hand, diffeology is a developing (although it is also already well-established) theory of "smooth spaces" introduced by J.M. Souriau and developed aggressively by P. Iglesias-Zemmour. One may view diffeology as a "smooth analogue" of topology: a set is endowed with a certain smooth structure (here, this amounts to choosing which maps from open subsets of Euclidean space into the set are to be considered smooth) subject to a few simple axioms. One of the reasons that diffeology first interested me is in how simple its formulation is, yet it provides interesting results. It recovers essentially all (I do not know of a counterexample) differential geometry results, while also giving insight on spaces that not even topology can give (see e.g. the irrational torus). I believe that diffeology can provide a strong framework for studying questions of mathematical quantization.
