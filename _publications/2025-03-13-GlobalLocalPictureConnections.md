excerpt: 'This is an explanation of the local and global pictures of principal $$G$$-bundles, as well as how these pictures are compatible with connections.'

Let $$M$$ be a smooth manifold and $$G$$ a Lie group. By a **local $$G$$-system on $$M$$**, we understand an open cover $$\{U_i : i \in I\}$$ of $$M$$ together with functions $$g_{ij} : U_i \cap U_j \to G$$ that satisfy the so-called _cocycle condition_ $$g_{ij}g_{jk} = g_{ik}.$$ We will show that any principal $$G$$-bundle $$\pi : P \to M$$ gives rise to a local $$G$$-system on $$M$$, and conversely any local $$G$$-system constructs a principal $$G$$-bundle over $$M$$ with a certain property. These constructions are actually compatible with connections in the sense that, roughly, a collection of $$G$$-valued $$1$$-forms defined locally on $$M$$ (which has a specified local G-system) will give rise to the usual connection $$1$$-form on the constructed bundle $$\pi : P \to M$$, and vice versa.
