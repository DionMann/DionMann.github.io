Let \\(K\\) be a compact metric space. Suppose that \\(\mu\\) is a finite Borel measure on \\(X\\). Then there is a positive  linear functional \\(C^0(K) \to \mathbb{R}\\) given by
\\[
f \mapsto \int f\ d\mu
\\]
It turns out that the converse of this observation also holds, namely that given a positive linear functional \\(T : C^0(K) \to \mathbb{R}\\) then there is a unique finite Borel measure \\(\mu\\) on \\(K\\) such that
\\[
Tf = \int f\ d\mu
\\]
for all \\(f\in C^0(K)\\). This result is known as the Riesz Representation theorem, which is the topic of this paper.
