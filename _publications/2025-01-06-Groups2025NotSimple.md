excerpt: 'This was part of my preparation for taking the algebra preliminary exam at UConn. I show that any group of order 2025 is not simple. i.e. has a nontrivial and proper normal subgroup.'

The algebra preliminary exam at UConn is famous for including a problem relating to the year of the prelim. Since I was taking the exam in 2025, I thought it would be a good idea to have this solution prepared. Unfortunately, the exam did not have this question (luckily I still passed!)

**Problem:** Let $$G$$ be a group with $$\|G\| = 2025 = 3^4 \cdot 5^2$$. Prove that $$G$$ is not simple, i.e. has a proper (nontrivial and a proper subset) normal subgroup.
